/* ============================================================================
 * A Postgres on localhost with nothing to install.
 *
 *     npm run db:local
 *
 * PGlite is a real PostgreSQL compiled to WebAssembly, shipped as an npm
 * package. This script wraps it in a TCP server that speaks the normal
 * PostgreSQL wire protocol, so the app, the migration script, the seed and
 * `psql` all connect to it exactly as they would to an installed Postgres —
 * the application code does not know the difference and needs no changes.
 *
 * Why this exists: installing PostgreSQL on Windows means an installer, admin
 * rights, a service, a superuser password and a PATH entry, and any one of
 * those going wrong stops the whole project. This is `npm install`.
 *
 * What it is NOT: a production database. Queries are serialised through one
 * engine, so it will not demonstrate the concurrency behaviour the inventory
 * tests prove — those want a real server. For looking at the shop, working on
 * pages and seeding a catalogue, it is the real PostgreSQL 18 query planner,
 * constraints, triggers, generated columns and all.
 *
 * Leave it running in its own terminal. The data lives in ./.localdb and
 * survives a restart.
